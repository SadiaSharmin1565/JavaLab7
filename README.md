Create a class named "Vehicle" with properties such as "brand", "model", "price", and "color".
Create two subclasses, "Car" and "Motorcycle," with additional properties specific to each class.
Create a main class to initialize objects of the subclasses, store them in an ArrayList, and display
their information. Use the 'super' keyword to call the constructor of the superclass from the
subclasses and utilize method overriding
